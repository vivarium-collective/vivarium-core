## v1.5.3
* (#211) Fix a memory leak when removing parallel processes.
* (#204) Implement a new serialization API based on PyMongo's 
  `TypeCodec` interface.

## v1.5.2

* (#207) Fix a bug in `Store.apply_update()` that caused failures when
  `self.value` was a list and `self.units` was set.
* (#205) Prevents formation of multi_updates when generating initial state.

## v1.5.1

* (#206) Support multiple emits for the same timestep and remove
  `Engine.complete()`. Instead, callers of `Engine.run_for()` must pass
  `force_complete=True` at the end of their caller-managed simulation
  loops.

## v1.4.2

* (#203) Make `Store.sources` more comprehensive, in particular by
  including dividers and flows.

## v1.4.1

* (#202) Add the `filters` argument to `data_from_database()` to allow
  further filtering of MongoDB query results.

## v1.3.1

* (#200) Inside Engine, store the Step execution layers as lists instead
  of sets to ensure deterministic execution order.
* (#201) Restore ability to pass `initial_state` keys in `settings`
  dictionaries to `composition.py` functions.

## v1.3.0

* (#198) Introduce process commands to support more interactions with
  parallel processes. Now all `Process` methods of a parallelized
  process can be queried from the parent OS process. Users can also add
  support for custom methods of their processes.

  This change also simplifies the way `Engine` handles parallel
  processes warns users when serializers are not being found
  efficiently.
* (#192) Marks `composition.py` as deprecated and ensures that the rest
  of Vivarium Core doesn't depend on it.
* (#199) Remove some Numpy dtypes that are not available on some
  platforms from serialize.py.

## v1.2.8

* (#186) Apply function to data from database emitter in `get_history_data_db`.

## v1.2.7

* (#190) makes `global_time_precision` an `Engine` parameter rather than `Engine.run_for()` keyword -- this changes the method introduced in 1.2.5. Technically a breaking API, but only from 2 versions ago.
* (#191) don't use timestep for quiet paths. This allows Engine to skip over processes that don't meet their update condition.

## v1.2.6

* (#189) track composite updates in engine so that the composite topology can be plotted after being updated.
* (#188) RAMEmitter returns query data only if it exists.

## v1.2.5

* (#183) floating-point timestep precision.
* (#182) add pytest to setup.
* (#180) Handle nan in units serializer.

## v1.2.4

* (#179) Register the injector process.
* (#178) Remove `compose_experiment()`, which was replaced by
  `Composite.merge()` long ago.

## v1.2.3

* (#176) Fix UnitsSerializer to correctly handle lists and tuples.

## v1.2.2

* (#175) `store_schema` arg to `Engine` allows us to override schema directly.

## v1.2.1

* (#172) bug fix to keep assembly_ids when passing queries to the DB.

## v1.2.0

* (#167) Make serialization more structured and robust with serializer
  classes that know what kinds of data they can serialize and
  deserialize.

## v1.1.1

* (#169) `get_history_data_db` no longer requires a 'time' key. It
  asserts an 'assembly_id' key instead.

## v1.1.0

* (#164) Add a `_no_original_parameters` configuration to `Process`
  that, if `True`, disables the copying of parameters that
  `Process.__init__()` does by default. Disabling this copying decreases
  memory usage, but it puts the user in charge of ensuring that
  parameters are not mutated.

## v1.0.2

* (#163) Fix two bugs:

  * In `divide_condition.py`, use a divider that sets the division
    variable to `False` instead of `0`.
  * In `engine.py`, fix the function that checks that every dependency
    in the flow is also in the dictionary of steps. This function did
    not correctly handle cases where steps were nested in
    sub-dictionaries.

## v1.0.1

* (#151) Make `Engine._run_steps()` public.
* (#155) Add error messages for flows that include steps not found in
  `Engine.steps` and for dividers specified as strings not found in the
  divider registry.
* (#157) Add flows and steps to the value returned by
  `Composite.generate_store()`.

## v1.0.0

* (#131) Do not assume that a process's `initial_state` should be used
  when using the Store API.
* (#132) Improve error message when no path exists between nodes in the
  hierarchy.
* (#133) Remove `Process.local_timestep()`, which is no longer being
  used.
* (#134) Support using `**` in a ports schema to connect to an entire
  subtree of the hierarchy.
* (#143) Make more methods private.
* (#147) Fix bug in process serialization to support changing the
  parameter argument name in the constructor.

## v0.4.20

* `deep_merge_combine_lists` recursive call.

## v0.4.19

* (#130) Raise an exception when a user specifies two different dividers
  for the same variable, and when serializing a process, use its
  original parameters without any changes that may have occurred since
  the process was initialized.

## v0.4.18

* (#127) build a `store` argument's topology views in `Engine` constructor to support the store API.

## v0.4.17

* (#126) A new method, `Engine.run_for`, can be called iteratively without completing
  processes on the front. `Engine.update` keeps the same behavior as before. `Engine.complete`
  forces all processes to complete at the current global time.

## v0.4.16

* (#125) Use the `null` divider by default for processes so that upon
  division, processes are generated by the composer, not a divider.

## v0.4.15

* (#123) Extend `Composite.merge` to use steps and flows.
* (#124) Use `set` divider by default.

## v0.4.14

* (#121) Fix a bug in `Store.divide()` where daughter cell states were
  by default the mother cell state. Instead, add support for an
  `initial_state` key in the `_divide` dictionary.
* (#122) Add an `_output` flag option to `Process.ports_schema`, which marks ports as output-only.

## v0.4.13

* Improve `topology_view` caching mechanism to speed up simulations that have a lot of division.

## v0.4.12

* Allow schema overrides to override step schemas.

## v0.4.11

* Assert that when `Engine` treats a process like a step, that process
  is actually a step.
* Use `Process.is_step()` to check whether a process is a step instead
  of using `isinstance`.

## v0.4.10

* Fix `Engine` to support flows that are nested dictionaries.

## v0.4.9

* Add `profile` argument to the `Engine` constructor. When this argument is set to `True`, the simulation, including any parallel processes, will be profiled by `cProfile`. Once `Engine.end()` is called, the profile stats will be saved to `Engine.stats` for analysis.

## v0.4.8

* Remove `self._run_steps()` from `Engine.apply_update` if `view_expire`.

## v0.4.7

* `view_expire` flag for `_add` and `_delete` updates as well.

## v0.4.6

* deepcopy mother state upon division so daughter states are ensured to not reference the same objects.
* improve `_get_composite_state` to avoid recursive deepcopy.
* add `view_expire` flag in `Store.apply_update`, and have `Engine` use this to trigger `self.state.build_topology_views`.

## v0.4.5

* Fixed a major bug introduced by `topology_view` in v0.4.3, which had glob (*) schema unable to view sub-stores.
* `dict_value` updater added to `updater_registry`.

## v0.4.4

* Add queries to `Emitter`, and to `get_history_data_db`. This allows you to selectively retrieve from paths
 in the data, and can save a lot of time when retrieving data from large experiments.

## v0.4.3

* Bug fix in the new `topology_view`, return `Store` for `'*'` schema.

## v0.4.2

* Add `topology_view` caching in `Store` to improve performance.

## v0.4.1

* Fix a bug in `Store.generate()` that caused conflicts between a user-provided initial state and a schema to raise an error instead of the initial state taking priority.

## v0.4.0

* Replaces `Deriver`s with `Step`s. While derivers were executed sequentially, steps are executed in topological generations according to a dependency graph. This lets some derivers run in parallel. This change mostly preserves backwards-compatibility since `Deriver` is now an alias for `Step`, and we still support legacy derivers that are specified without dependencies. These legacy derivers are executed sequentially before any steps. However, the minor version is incremented because the following public interfaces have changed (though we don't expect this to break dependent code):

  * `Composite`s now have 2 more keys: `steps` and `flow`.
  * `Engine.run_derivers()` has been replaced by `Engine._run_steps()`.
  * `Engine.deriver_paths` has been replaced by `Engine._step_paths`.
  * New lists of step and flow updates have been added to the tuple returned by `Store.apply_update()`.
  * `Store.EMPTY_UPDATES` has two more `None` values and is now private (`Store._EMPTY_UPDATES`).
  * `Store.get_processes()` no longer returns steps (formerly "derivers"). Instead, these are returned by `get_steps()`.
  * Makes `Store.generate_paths()` private (now `Store._generate_paths()`).
  * Adds required `step` and `flow` arguments to `Store.generate()`.
  * Adds `metadata` argument to `Engine`.

* Fixes a bug where parallel derivers were re-instantiated every timestep.
* Marks the Store API as experimental, including the public use of `Store.move()`, `Store.insert()`, `Store.divide()`, and `Store.delete()`.

## v0.3.14
