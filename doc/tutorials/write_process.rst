How to Write a Process
======================

--------------------
Why Write Processes?
--------------------

Vivarium comes with a number of :term:`processes` ready for you to use,
but combining processes to form :term:`compartments` will only take you so
far. For many models, the existing processes will be insufficient, so
you will need to create your own.

.. note::
    Processes are the building blocks of Vivarium models, so creating a
    process to model a phenomenon you know well lets other modelers
    build on your expertise. Processes are a great way to share your
    knowledge with the modeling community!

----------------------
Let's Write a Process!
----------------------

Suppose we want to model how hexokinase helps maintain intracellular
glucose concentrations. Hexokinase catalyzes glucose phosphorylation,
which we can describe by the following reaction:

.. math::

    GLC + ATP \rightleftarrows G6P + ADP

In the reaction above and throughout this tutorial, we will use the
following abbreviations:

* GLC: D-Glucose
* ATP: Adenosine triphosphate
* G6P: |agr|-D-Glucose-6-phosphate
* ADP: Adenosine diphosphate
* v: Rate of the forward reaction
* HK: Hexokinase

.. tip:: Once you have worked through the example in this tutorial, try
    modeling a different reaction that you work with!

Conceptualize the Model
=======================

Make Assumptions
----------------

A critical component of modeling is deciding what parts to describe
mechanistically and what to approximate. For our scenario, we could
model this reaction using molecular dynamics, but this would be
computationally intensive and would not scale to larger simulations.
Instead, we will assume Michaelis-Menten, sequential bisubstrate
kinetics:

.. math::

    v = \frac{k_{cat}[HK][GLC][ATP]}{K_{GLC}K_{ATP} + K_{GLC}[ATP] +
        K_{ATP}[GLC] + [GLC][ATP]}

Let's also assume that diffusion is much faster than the reaction so
that the concentrations of our enzyme and substrates are constant
throughout the cell.

.. note:: If you actually wanted to model a reaction like this, the
   ``ConvenienceKinetics`` process can be configured to model any
   Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics.

Translate Model into Updates
----------------------------

Processes in Vivarium work by repeatedly changing the state of the
model. A process makes these changes by computing an update based on the
model's current state and a :term:`timestep` :math:`t`.

For the current example, each update will include the following:

* A decrease in GLC: :math:`-v t`
* A decrease in ATP: :math:`-v t`
* An increase in G6P: :math:`v t`
* An increase in ADP: :math:`v t`

.. note:: In this example and most of the time in Vivarium, we work in
    terms of concentrations. We also normally use units of mM, but you
    can use different units so long as you are consistent.

Determine the Ports
-------------------

We partition the overall model state into :term:`stores`, which can be
shared among processes. Each process declares :term:`ports`, each of
which will receive a store. When creating a process, you need to decide
what ports to declare.

When someone else uses your process, they will create a
:term:`compartment` of it and other processes. These processes will
interact by sharing stores. While any number of your process's ports may
be linked to the same store, a port cannot be split between stores. This
means that you should put in separate ports any :term:`variables` that a
user might want in separate stores.

For example, ATP and ADP are turned over rapidly in the cell, so a user
might want to isolate those variables from others that get updated more
slowly. We will therefore create two ports:

* ``nucleoside_phosphates``: This port will store the ``ATP`` and
  ``ADP`` variables.
* ``cytoplasm``: This port will store the ``GLC``, ``G6P``, and ``HK``
  variables.

Implement the Model
===================

To implement the model, create a new Python file named
``glucose_phosphorylation.py`` in the ``vivarium/processes/`` directory.
Then we create a new class that inherits from
:py:class:`vivarium.core.process`:

.. code-block:: python

    from vivarium.core.process import Process

    class GlucosePhosphorylation(Process):
        pass

The Constructor
---------------

We declare the ports in the constructor as a dictionary that maps from
port name to a list of the names of the variables we need to be in that
port.

In the constructor we can also configure the process. We accept
configurations as a dictionary called ``initial_parameters``. For
example, we can let the user configure the kinetic parameters
:math:`k_{cat}`, :math:`K_{GLC}`, and :math:`K_{ATP}`. We can also
provide default values for these parameters.

The configurations (with any missing parameters filled in with defaults)
and ports are passed to the superclass constructor to instantiate the
process.

.. code-block:: python

    import copy

    from vivarium.core.process import Process

    class GlucosePhosphorylation(Process):

        defaults = {
            'k_cat': 2e-3,
            'K_ATP': 5e-2,
            'K_GLC': 4e-2,
        }

        def __init__(self, initial_parameters=None):
            if initial_parameters == None:
                initial_parameters = {}
            parameters = copy.deepcopy(GlucosePhosphorylation.defaults)
            parameters.update(initial_parameters)
            super(GlucosePhosphorylation, self).__init__(
                parameters)

The ``global`` port is special: it stores information that needs to be
shared across many processes but that is more like "metadata" than
molecule concentrations. For this example, we'll store the mass of the
``cytoplasm`` port's contents.

Even though we're just getting started on our process, let's try it out!
At the bottom of the ``glucose_phosphorylation.py`` file, instantiate
the process and take a look at some of its attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parameters = {
            'k_cat': 1.5,
        }
        my_process = GlucosePhosphorylation(parameters)
        print(my_process.parameters['k_cat'])
        print(my_process.parameters['K_ATP'])

Then run your code by executing the whole file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python glucose_phosphorylation.py
    1.5
    0.05

Notice that the ``k_cat`` parameter updated to the value we supplied and
that ``k_ATP`` took on the default value.

But wait! Where did the ``parameters`` attribute come from? We never
created that attribute, but
:py:class:`vivarium.core.process.Process` made it  from the
``parameters`` argument we passed to its constructor. We'll take
advantage of this in the next step.

Generating Updates
------------------

Now we can write the ``next_update`` method, which generates updates for
each port based on a provided model state and timestep.

.. WARNING:: The ``states`` parameter passed into the update function is
    a view of the overall state, so it must not be changed.

.. code-block:: python

        def next_update(self, timestep, states):
            # Get concentrations from state
            cytoplasm = states['cytoplasm']
            nucleoside_phosphates = states['nucleoside_phosphates']
            hk = cytoplasm['HK']
            glc = cytoplasm['GLC']
            atp = nucleoside_phosphates['ATP']

            # Get kinetic parameters
            k_cat = self.parameters['k_cat']
            k_atp = self.parameters['K_ATP']
            k_glc = self.parameters['K_GLC']

            # Compute reaction rate with michaelis-menten equation
            rate = k_cat * hk * glc * atp / (
                k_glc * k_atp + k_glc * atp + k_atp * glc + glc * atp)

            # Compute concentration changes from rate and timestep
            delta_glc = -rate * timestep
            delta_atp = -rate * timestep
            delta_g6p = rate * timestep
            delta_adp = rate * timestep

            # Compile changes into an update
            update = {
                'cytoplasm': {
                    'GLC': delta_glc,
                    'G6P': delta_g6p,
                    # We exclude HK because it doesn't change
                },
                'nucleoside_phosphates': {
                    'ATP': delta_atp,
                    'ADP': delta_adp,
                },
            }

            return update

Now let's test this update function by seeing how it changes a state we
provide. Replace the testing code we added to the bottom of the file
with this:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parameters = {
            'k_cat': 1.5,
        }
        my_process = GlucosePhosphorylation(parameters)
        state = {
            'cytoplasm': {
                'GLC': 1.0,
                'G6P': 0.0,
                'HK': 0.1,
            },
            'nucleoside_phosphates': {
                'ATP': 2.0,
                'ADP': 0.0,
            },
        }
        update = my_process.next_update(3.0, state)
        print(update['cytoplasm']['G6P'])

With these parameters, we can calculate the reaction rate:

.. math::

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            v & = \frac{
                k_{cat}[HK][GLC][ATP]
            }{
                K_{GLC}K_{ATP} + K_{GLC}[ATP] + K_{ATP}[GLC]
                + [GLC][ATP]
            } \\
            & = \frac{
                (1.5)(0.1)(1)(2)
            }{
                (0.04)(0.05) + (0.04)(2) + (0.05)(1) + (1)(2)
            } \\
            & = 0.14 \\
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

Therefore, we expect the change in concentration of G6P to be:

.. math::

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \Delta_{[GLC]} & = v t \\
            & = (0.14)(3) \\
            & = 0.42 \\
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

Let's see if our process models this reaction as we expect:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python glucose_phosphorylation.py
    0.4221388367729832

Hooray! This is what we expected.

Ports Schema and Derivers
-------------------------

Our process works, but we had to manually set the state. We also haven't
shown yet how to apply the update we generate to the model state.
Luckily for us, these steps will be handled automatically by Vivarium.
We just need to create a ``ports_schema`` method that provides a
:term:`schema`. A schema is a nested dictionary that describes each
variable the process will interact with. Each variable is defined by a
dictionary of :term:`schema keys` that specify its default value, how it
should be updated, and other properties.

For this example, our updates are expressed as deltas that should be
added to the old value of the variable. This is the default, so the
schema can leave out the updater specification. Still, we'll specify one
of the :term:`updaters` for demonstration.

.. code-block:: python

    def ports_schema(self):
        return {
            'cytoplasm': {
                'GLC': {
                    # accumulate means to add the updates
                    '_updater': 'accumulate',
                    '_default': 1.0,
                    '_properties': {
                        'mw': 1.0 * units.g / units.mol,
                    },
                    '_emit': True,
                },
                # accumulate is the default, so we don't need to specify
                # updaters for the rest of the variables
                'G6P': {
                    '_default': 0.0,
                    '_properties': {
                        'mw': 1.0 * units.g / units.mol,
                    },
                    '_emit': True,
                },
                'HK': {
                    '_default': 0.1,
                    '_properties': {
                        'mw': 1.0 * units.g / units.mol,
                    },
                },
            },
            'nucleoside_phosphates': {
                'ATP': {
                    '_default': 2.0,
                    '_emit': True,
                },
                'ADP': {
                    '_default': 0.0,
                    '_emit': True,
                }
            },
            'global': {
            },
        }

We also can add :term:`derivers` with the ``derivers`` method. Derivers
perform calculations for us that would be tedious to re-compute in many
processes. For example, calculating the mass of the cell's enzyme and
sugar contents, as we see in this example:

.. code-block:: python

    def derivers(self):
        return {
            'my_deriver': {
                'deriver': 'mass_deriver',
                'port_mapping': {
                    'global': 'global',
                },
                'config': {},
            },
        }

Now, we can run a simulation using Vivarium's
:py:func:`vivarium.core.composition.simulate_process` function
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from vivarium.core.composition import simulate_process
    from vivarium.plots.simulation_output import plot_simulation_output

    ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parameters = {
            'k_cat': 1.5,
        }
        my_process = GlucosePhosphorylation(parameters)

        settings = {
            'total_time': 10,
        }
        timeseries = simulate_process(my_process, settings)
        plot_simulation_output(timeseries, {}, './')

We use
:py:class:`vivarium.plots.simulation_output.plot_simulation_output` to
plot the output from our simulation. In ``simulation.png`` you should
see an output plot like this:

.. image:: /_static/process_tutorial_long_timestep.png
    :width: 100%

.. tip:: If a process is erroneously reporting negative values, try
    decreasing the timestep.

Oops, it looks like the cytoplasmic GLC concentration dropped below zero
around time 8! This happens when the timestep is too long and so our
approximation doesn't adjust fast enough to dropping concentrations. To
fix this, let's change the timestep to ``0.1``.

.. note:: You may be wondering, "What units is the timestep in?" The
    answer is that it doesn't matter! We just need the parameters and
    timestep to use the same unit of time.

Here's the ``settings`` dictionary with the updated timestep:

.. code-block:: python

    settings = {
        'total_time': 10,
        'timestep': 0.1,
    }

Now if we run the file again, we should get a ``simulation.png`` like
this:

.. image:: /_static/process_tutorial_short_timestep.png
    :width: 100%

You can download the completed process file :download:`here
<../../vivarium/processes/glucose_phosphorylation.py>`.

Great job; you've written a new process! Now consider writing one to
model a mechanism you are familiar with.
