Introduction
------------

A vivarium, literally a "place of life," is a controlled environment in
which organisms can be studied. You might have encountered examples of
vivaria like an aquarium or a terrarium. The Vivarium project provides a
framework for building biological systems in-silico.

Vivarium does not include any specific modeling frameworks, but instead
focuses on the interface between such frameworks, and provides a powerful
multiscale simulation engine that combines and runs them. Users of Vivarium
can therefore implement any type of model module they prefer -- whether it
is a custom module of a specific biophysical system, a configurable model
with its own standard format, or a wrapper for an off-the-shelf library. The
multiscale engine supports complex agents operating at multiple timescales,
and facilitates parallel computation across multiple CPUs.
